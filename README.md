# Damage Counter
This plugin will display the damage you did to a boss.

A real time counter is displayed during the boss kill. When the boss dies, the real time counter is reset to 0. 

A message will be sent to the chat window detaining how much damage you did, as well as what percentage of the boss' total health that was.
